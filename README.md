## About me
As an app developer, I write and maintain code, collaborate with team members, debug issues, and ensure applications run smoothly. Outside of work, I go out for a cup of coffee or for some snack, meet friends. When I have some free time, I take a bicycle and go for a ride. I'm glad to respond, you can message me here calechfs@gmail.com
