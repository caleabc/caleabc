## Hello.
.

.

## My day-to-day work.
As an app developer, I write and maintain code, collaborate with team members, debug issues, and ensure our applications run smoothly and efficiently.

## Outside of work.
Going out for a cup of coffee or for some snack, meeting friends. When I have some free time, I take a bicycle and go for a ride, and spend an hour this really depends on my mood and energy levels.

## I'm glad to respond
You can message me here calechfs@gmail.com
